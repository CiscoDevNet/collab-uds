## Step 2: Retrieve the current Speed Dial list

> UDS /speedDials URL

```
https://sandboxicf.cisco.com:9443/cucm-uds/user/{username}/speedDials
```

UDS allows applications to retrieve various kinds of user data from Unified Communications Manager.  One of the available resources -- `/cucm-uds/user/{username}/speedDials` -- returns a list of the current Speed Dials configured on the user's phone.

1. Find your workstation's user name in the yellow floating bar below.  The password for all lab users is `password`
<aside style="font-style:italic; border:1px solid">If you are not using this lab at a Cisco event or the yellow bar is not present, pick a username from the range `labuser1..labuser32`</aside>

2. Open the Postman REST client plugin: in the browser, click the **Apps** button on the shortcut toolbar, then select **Postman - REST Client**.  (If necessary, click the **Reset** button to clear any previously entered data.)

3. Construct a REST GET request for the UDS `/speedDials` resource
	* In the field marked *Enter request URL here* put the URL for the local UC Manager's UDS `/speedDials` resource (see the URL listed above).  Make sure to replace `{username}` with the UDS lab username for your workstation
	* From the request method dropdown box, make sure **GET** is selected
	* Select the **Basic Auth** tab, enter your UDS username and password, then click **Refresh headers**

4. Click the **Send** button to launch the request
<aside style="font-style:italic; border:1px solid">If you get an error message like 'Could not get any response', you may need to permanently/temporarily accept the server's security certificate.  If using Postman/Chrome, you can open a separate Chrome tab, visit https://sandboxicf:9443/cucm-uds/users , follow the 'Advanced' options to temporarily accept the certificate, then return to Postman and retry the request</aside>

Take a look at the XML data returned.  If the `<speedDials>` element is empty, go ahead and proceed to 'Step 3: Add a new Speed Dial'

<aside style="font-style:italic; border:1px solid">If your phone already has some Speed Dials configured, you may jump to 'Step 5: Remove Speed Dials' to remove them first!  Return here when you're done.'</aside>
