## Step 3: Add a new Speed Dial

> UDS /speedDials URL

```shell
https://sandboxicf.cisco.com:9443/cucm-uds/user/{username}/speedDials
```

Adding new configuration items to UDS - such as a Speed Dial - requires the REST **POST** method along with  some XML data in the body of the request with the necessary details.  Let's add a Speed Dial to the phone in Speed Dial position 1, with the label 'Push Me', set to dial the video test stream phone number '6001':

> XML for adding a new Speed Dial

```xml
<speedDials>
    <speedDial>
        <index>1</index>
        <number>6001</number>
        <label>Push Me</label>
    </speedDial>
</speedDials>
```

1. If necessary, clear the Postman client settings with the **Reset** button

2. Construct the POST request to add a Speed Dial
  * In the field marked *Enter request URL here* put the URL for the local UC Manager's UDS `/speedDials` resource (see the the URL listed above).  Make sure to replace `{username}` with the UDS username for your workstation
  * From the request method dropdown box, make sure **POST** is selected
  * Enable the **Headers** button, and add a header with 'Header' as `Content-Type` and 'Value' as `application/xml`
  * Select the **Basic Auth** tab, enter your UDS username and password, then click **Refresh headers**
  * Select the **raw** body type button
	* Enter the XML for the new Speed Dial into the body text box (see the code example listed above)

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request
