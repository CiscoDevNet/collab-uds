## Step 5: Remove Speed Dials

> UDS /speedDials URL

```shell
https://hq-cucm-pub.abc.inc:8443/cucm-uds/user/<username>/speedDials
```

Removing configuration items from UDS requires using the REST **DELETE** request method.  To remove all of the user's Speed Dials, we can simply call the `/speedDials` URL using HTTP DELETE.

1. If necessary, clear the Postman client settings with the **Reset** button

2. Construct the DELETE request to remove the user's Speed Dials
	* In the field marked *Enter request URL here* put the URL for the local UC Manager's UDS `/speedDials` resource.  Make sure to replace `<username>` with the UDS username for your workstation (see the URL listed above)
	* From the request method dropdown box, make sure **DELETE** is selected
	* Select the **Basic Auth** tab, enter your UDS lab username and password, then click **Refresh headers**

3. Click the **Send** button to launch the request
